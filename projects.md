<p>
OpenMusic was my main project while working at IRCAM. This visual programming language based on Lisp was initially developed at Ircam by <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/person/carlos-agon-amado/" target="_blank">Carlos Agon</a> and <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/person/gerard-assayag/" target="_blank">Gérard Assayag</a> while I was still in the playgrounds. I worked as a developer for the first few years I was there, and released the first multi-platform (Mac/Windows) version of the environment (<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01161332" target="_blank">OM5</a>) in 2005. OM6 was then released just a few years later, in 2008. It is still the version that is used today ! In 2012 I started to collaborate with <a href="https://www.avinjar.no/" target="_">Anders Vinjar</a> with the support of the Norwegian centers BEK and Notam, on a <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01075235" target="_">Linux version</a> that is now also available.
</p>

<p>
OpenMusic has grown to be a reference environment for computer-assisted music composition, today used, and taught by <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/openmusic/ombook" target="_">many composers</a> in many institutions worldwide.    
</p>

<p>
While continuing to maintain and support OpenMusic, in recent years I have started working on a new implementation of the environment as an outcome for several research projects, and I have progressively focused on what has now become <a href="https://cac-t-u-s.github.io/om-sharp/" target="_blank">OM#</a>.

<tr><th> Symbolist (2018) </th></tr>
<tr><td>

<img src="images/symbolist.png" width="240" align="right"/>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/ramagottfried/symbolist" target="_blank">Symbolist</a> is a collaboration with composer <a href="http://www.ramagottfried.com/" target="_blank">Rama Gottfried</a>, started in 2018 during his musical research residency at IRCAM.
</p>
<p>
Our objective was to create a graphic notation environment for music and multimedia, enabling graphical editing, programming, and streaming of multi-rate/multidimensional control data encoded as OSC structures.
</p>

<p>
Vincent Iampietro (Master's student) also worked on the develoment of the current prototype.
Rama is now continuing this project at the Hochschule Für Musik in Hamburg.

<p>I was at UC Berkeley in 2016 in a <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/projects/jean-bresson-interactive-visual-programming-systems-music-composition" target="_blank">Fulbright Research scholarship</a>, where I had the chance to collaborate with <a href="http://john-maccallum.com/" target="_blank">John MacCallum</a>, <a href="https://adrianfreed.com/" target="_blank">Andrian Freed</a> and other <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CNMAT</a> fellows on the development of applications of the <i>odot</i> library in OM.</p>

<tr><th> EFFICACe: Interactivity in Computer-Assisted Composition Processes (2013-2017) </th></tr>
<tr><td>

<img src="images/trajectoires.jpg" width="240" align="right"/>
<p>
EFFICACe was an exploratory research project that I coordinated at Ircam, funded by the French <a href="https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-13-JS02-0004" target="_blank"> National research Agency</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The project explored the relations between computation, time and interactions in computer-aided music composition, using OpenMusic and other technologies developed at IRCAM and at <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CNMAT</a>. Considering computer-aided composition out of its traditional "offline" paradigm, we tried to integrate compositional processes in structured interactions with their context: the interactions taking place during executions or performances, or at the early compositional stages (in the processes that lead to the creation of musical material). In this perspective we have studied reactive approaches for computer-aided composition, the notion of dynamic time structures in computation and music, rhythmic and symbolic time structures, and new modalities for the interactive control, visualisation and execution of sound synthesis and spatialization processes. 
</p>
<p>
I have worked on this project with <a href="" target="_blank">Dimitri Bouche</a> (PhD student), <a href="http://recherche.enac.fr/~jeremie.garcia/" target="_blank">Jérémie Garcia</a> (post-doctoral researcher), <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/person/thibaut-carpentier/" target="_blank">Thibaut Carpentier</a> (CNRS/Ircam), <a href="http://imtr.ircam.fr/imtr/Diemo_Schwarz" target="_blank">Diemo Schwarz</a> (Ircam) and <a href="https://jacquema.gitlabpages.inria.fr/" target="_blank">Florent Jacquemard</a> (Inria/Ircam). 

EFFICACe research also led to most of the novel features of the <a href="https://cac-t-u-s.github.io/om-sharp/" target="_blank">OM#</a> environment.

<p>
SDIF-Edit was my first, student internship project developed when I started at IRCAM in 2003.
It is a 3D visualizer and editor developed in OpenGL, allowing to view the contents of SDIF files (<a href="http://sdif.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Sound Description Interchange Format</a>, a file format used by music applications to store dan exchange sounds analysis data, synthesis parameters, etc.)
