I am a computer music researcher and software engineer: this page contains resources and links to some present and past activity and projects.

I am currently working at <a href="http://www.ableton.com" target="_blank">Ableton</a>, as a team Product Owner on the company's flagship software, <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/" target="_blank">Live</a>.

Before that — from 2003 to 2019 — I was at <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/recherche/" target="_blank">IRCAM</a> in the <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/bresson" target="_blank">Music Representations team</a> of the <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/" target="_blank">STMS lab (Science and Technology of Music and Sound)</a>. My main focus and expertise is in computer-assisted music composition and domain-specific (visual) programming: I was the principal developer and researcher in charge of the <a href="https://openmusic-project.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenMusic</a> project since 2008. My principal contributions consisted in connecting the environment to digital sound processing, spatialization, and real-time interaction systems (see <a href="projects#om">the projects page</a>). 

I obtained my PhD from the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in 2007, and my [_Habilitation_ degree (HDR)]((https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01525998/)) in 2017.
In 2016 I was awarded a Fulbright [research scholarship](http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/projects/jean-bresson-interactive-visual-programming-systems-music-composition) carried out at [CNMAT](http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/) / UC Berkeley, USA.
In 2018-2019 I was also part-time guest lecturer at the [Institut für Musikwissenschaft und Musikinformatik](http://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/imwi/index.htm) of the Hochschule für Musik in Karlsruhe, Germany.

<p>
<b>OM#</b> is a computer assisted composition and visual programming environment derived from <a href="https://openmusic-project.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenMusic</a> (see <a href="projects#om">past projects</a>), featuring a fully redesigned visual programming framework, as well as advanced tools for interactive computer assisted composition and digital signal processing.
</p>
<p>
The environment was initially concieved as a new implementation of OpenMusic. Key features and developments were carried out during the <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/efficace/" target="_blank">EFFICACe</a> research project (2013-2017), while exploring interactive approaches in computer-assisted music composition processes: timeline-based interactive control of musical objects, dynamic scheduling architecture for musical rendering and computation, new interfaces for the temporal representation of compositional processes.
The "reactive" model, previously introduced as a prototype in OpenMusic, was also integrated as a native feature.
</p>
<p>
After successive code-names (om7-beta/o7/...) the project was named <b>OM#</b> (om-sharp) shortly before the v1.0 release in the end of 2019.

#### Community 


In 2015, together with a few colleagues from the French Computer Music Association (AFIM), I participated in the creation of [TENOR](https://www.tenor-conference.org), the International Conference on Technologies for Music Notation and Representation. I was the general chair of the conference steering committee between 2018 and 2021, and still a member of this committee until 2024.
<br>
I am also part of the steering committee of [AFIM](http://afim-asso.org), the French Computer Music Association.
<br>
Between 2017 and 2023 I was in the [FARM](https://functional-art.org) steering committee (ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design).

<br>
I was the coordinator of the following events, research groups or seminars:    
- [MaMuX: Mathematics, Music and relations to other disciplines](http://repmus.ircam.fr/mamux/) (2011-2014, IRCAM, Paris — 8 annual half-day sessions, 80+ speakers).
- [MusICAL network Seminar Series](http://repmus.ircam.fr/musical/) on Interaction, Calculus, Algorithmics and Languages applied to Music \[FR\] (2015-2018).
- [New spaces of music notation](http://notation.afim-asso.org/) work group of the AFIM (French computer music association) (2013-2015)
- [MCM]() International conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music (2011, IRCAM, Paris).

- Research workshops: 
  - [Interactivity in Music Composition and Performance](http://repmus.ircam.fr/efficace/events/workshop-cirmmt) (CIRMMT / McGill University, Montreal, Canada 2015)
