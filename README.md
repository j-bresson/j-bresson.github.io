I am a computer music researcher and software engineer. This page contains links and resources related to some recent projects. 

From 2003 to 2019 I worked at <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/recherche/" target="_blank">IRCAM</a> in the <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/" target="_blank">Music Representations team</a> of the <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/" target="_blank">STMS lab (Science and Technology of Music and Sound)</a>. My main focus area was computer-aided music composition and domain-specific (visual) programming systems for composers: I have been the developer and researcher in charge of the <a href="https://openmusic-project.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenMusic project</a> during this time, and particularly worked towards connecting it to digital sound processing, spatialization, or real-time interaction systems. 

I obtained my PhD from the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in 2007, and my [_Habilitation_ degree (HDR)]((https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01525998/)) in 2017. I was appointed Senior Researcher (_Directeur de Recherches_) at Ircam at the end of 2019.
In 2016 I was at [CNMAT](http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/) / UC Berkeley with a [grant](http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/projects/jean-bresson-interactive-visual-programming-systems-music-composition) from the Fulbright French-American commission. 
In 2018-2019 I was also part-time guest lecturer at the [Institut für Musikwissenschaft und Musikinformatik](http://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/imwi/index.htm) of the Hochschule für Musik in Karlsruhe, Germany. 

In 2020 I joined <a href="http://www.ableton.com" target="_blank">Ableton</a> in Berlin and am now working there as a software engineer.

<p>
<b>om#</b> is a computer assisted composition and visual programming environment derived from <a href="https://openmusic-project.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenMusic</a> (see <a href="projects#om">past projects</a>), featuring a fully redesigned visual programming framework, as well as advanced tools for interactive computer assisted composition and digital signal processing.

I am the "Tech Project coordinator" of <a href="https://aaroneinbond.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Einbond</a>'s Vertigo S+T+ARTS residency <i>Cosmologies of the Concert Grand Piano</i>.
</p>
<p>
In this project, we are bringing together the results of recent research projects on granular/concatenative synthesis, spatialization (and a little bit of machine learning), in order to implement a model of spatial synthesis based of 3D-radiation patterns of acoustic instruments, running on Max and OpenMusic/OM#.

<tr><th> PACO: Artificial Intelligence and Computer-Assisted Composition (2018-2019) </th></tr>
<tr><td>

<img src="images/om-ai.png" width="300" align="right"/>
<p>
PACO is a start-up funding from the CNRS "PEPS" program for an exploratory project about artificial intelligence (just like everybody else!), machine learning and computer-assisted composition.
</p>
<p>
With this project our objective was to explore the possibility for composers to use AI and machine learning techniques within the framework of creative processes (and not as a substitution or complement to creativity), for the generation or transformation of musical data, or the resolution of musical problems dealing with abstract characteristics of musical structures, which are sometimes difficult to quantify and treat explicitly by classical programming techniques.
</p>

<p>
Composers <a href="https://www.avinjar.no/" target="_">Anders Vinjar</a>, <a href="https://www.alirezafarhang.com/post/traces-of-expressivity-data-stream" target="_">Alireza Farhang</a>, as well as Paul Best (software engeneering intern, co-supervised with Diemo Schwarz) were my main collaborators on this project. 
Anders Vinjar is currently following-up on it, in the context of a musical research residency at IRCAM (2019-2020).
