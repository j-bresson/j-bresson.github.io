I'm a computer music researcher and software engineer. 
From 2003 to 2019 I worked at <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/recherche/" target="_blank">IRCAM</a> in the <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/" target="_blank">Music Representations team</a> of the <a href="https://www.stms-lab.fr/" target="_blank">STMS lab (Science and Technology of Music and Sound)</a>. My main focus area was computer-aided music composition and domain-specific (visual) programming systems for composers: I have been the developer and researcher in charge of the <a href="https://openmusic-project.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenMusic project</a> during this time, and particularly worked towards connecting it to digital sound processing, spatialization, or real-time interaction systems. 

I obtained my doctorate from the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in 2007, and passed my [_Habilitation_ degree (HDR)]((https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01525998/)) in 2017. 
In 2016 I got a grant from the Fulbright French-American commission for a [research scholarship at CNMAT, UC Berkeley](http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/projects/jean-bresson-interactive-visual-programming-systems-music-composition). I was appointed Senior IRCAM Researcher (_Directeur de Recherches_) at the end of 2019.

I have given numerous invited talks and workshops about OpenMusic and computer assisted compositon. In 2018-2019 I was part-time guest lecturer at the [Institut für Musikwissenschaft und Musikinformatik](http://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/imwi/index.htm) of the Hochschule für Musik in Karlsruhe, Germany.
